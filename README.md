## üìë Introduction
School 42's `minishell` is the first two-person big project. The goal is to create a basic working shell inspired by bash.
All the features of this `minishell` :
- Custom prompt showing the current directory.
- A working history with the up arrow.
- Searching the $PATH variable to execute commands.
- Handle single quote and not interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence.
- Handle double quote and not interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence except for dollar sign.
- Redirections :
	- Output redirection `>`
	- Output redirection append mode `>>`
	- Input redirection `<`
	- Here document `<<`
- Pipes `|`.
- Environment variables with `$`.
- Handle `$?` which expand to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.
- Handle signals :
	- `ctrl-C` Kills the running program and display a new prompt.
	- `ctrl-D` Closes the standard input if readed, exits minishell otherwise.
	- `ctrl-\` Does nothing.
- Some builtins
	- `echo` with option -n.
	- `cd` with `.`, `..` and `-` arguments.
	- `pwd` without options.
	- `export` without options.
	- `unset` without options.
	- `env` without options.
	- `exit` without options.
- `&&` and `||` operators with parenthesis.
- Wildcards `~` and `*`.
